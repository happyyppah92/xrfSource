# xrfSource
XrfSource is a Java program to calculate the x-ray intensity distribution of an x-ray tube.

The program implements a number of wellknown algorithms for the calculation of the intensity spectrum sent from an x-ray tube.
The program is a modular Java program, the new Java concept started with Java 9. The executable is self contained, so additional
Java runtime environment modules are not required.

Tools used for the development:
* Apache Netbeans version 11.1, an Open Source development platform.
* OpenJDK version 13.0.1 (Java development Kit)
* OpenJFX version 11.0.2 (Java FX for the GUI development)
* Gluon JavaFX Screen Builder version 11.0.0 (GUI for development of the progran Java FX based GUI).
